Our paper "Encoding protein dynamic information in graph representation for functional residue identification" is published in ***Cell Reparts Physical Science***. 

Protein function prediction, a further pursuit in the post-protein-structureprediction era, offers tremendous opportunities in molecular science, biotechnology, and pharmaceutics. In protein, it is believed that *sequence-encodes-structures-encodes-dynamics-encodes-functions*. Howwever, the systemetic way to incorporate dynamic information in deep learning architecture remains elusive for protein function prediction task. 

In this article, we try to emphasize that dynamic information is important for functional residue identification using graph neural networks. Normal mode analysis is used to augment protein graphs by adding extra edges between residues with high motion correlation. These *correlation edges* faciliate non-local message passing for enhanced functional inference and help extract dynamically-critical residues with functional impacts.
