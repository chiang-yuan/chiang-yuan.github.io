Welcome to my cyber nook! I am **Yuan Chiang** (æ±Ÿå…ƒ, pronounced as 'You-and John'). I also go by the name **Cyrus**. Currently I am a PhD student in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/), under the guidance of [Prof. Mark Asta](https://asta.mse.berkeley.edu/). I leverage quantum mechanical calculation and develop machine learning on supercomputers to drive our understanding and innovations in physical sciences. I recently work on the devlopement and benchmark of foundation machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) and use them as a probe to understand and design materials under extreme environments in Gen IV molten salt fission reactors (MSRs).

**My research interests** broadly lie in computational materials physics and chemistry at the atomic and molecular levels, with an emphasis on the theory and application of *ab-initio* calculations, molecular dynamics, and machine learning to tackle challenges across energy, materials, pharmaceutics, devices, and computing. 

**Previously** I earned my BS in [Civil Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) and MS in [Structural Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Shu-Wei Chang](https://www.swc-lab.tw/). I was a structural engineering intern at [T.Y. LIN](https://www.tylin.com/) in 2018 and was a full-stack intern at [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw/) in 2021.

**Yes!** I had an *unorthodox* transition from "civil" to "materials science" (they are at the opposite ends of spectrum in terms of the length scale if you will) after years of working with Prof. Chang in civil engineering department because he is too nice and I was too numb not seeing what I really want to pursue, thanks to the spoon-feeding education system in Taiwan and my self-deception from the uninformed, vague childhood interest in civil structure ðŸ™ƒ. Fortunately, I had Prof. Chang's unwavering guidance that enlightened me to use my gift and interest for fundamental science and technology. :stars:
