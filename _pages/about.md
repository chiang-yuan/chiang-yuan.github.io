Welcome! You have bumped into Yuan's personal website. I am now a PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working with [Prof. Mark Asta](https://asta.mse.berkeley.edu/) on materials under extreme environment in Gen IV molten salt fission reactor (MSR) by leveraging scientific computing and machine learning approches.

**My research interests** broadly lie in computational materials physics and mechanics at the atomic and molecular levels, with an emphasis on the theory and application of *ab initio* calculations, molecular dynamics, and machine learning to tackle challenges across energy, materials, pharmaceutics, devices, and computing. 

<!-- The nature of my research is highly multidisciplinary, requiring a knack to analyze and interpret a wealth amount of data in multi-scale systems across different time (from femtoseconds to years) and length (from Angstroms to meters) scales.  -->

**Previously** I earned my BS in [Civil Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) and MS in [Structural Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), under the supervision by [Prof. Shu-Wei Chang](https://www.swc-lab.tw/). I was a structural engineering intern at [T.Y. LIN](https://www.tylin.com/) in 2018 and was a full-stack intern at [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw/) in 2021.  

**Yes!** I had an *unorthodox* transition from "civil" to "materials science" (they are at the opposite ends of spectrum in terms of the length scale and STEM fields if you agree) after years of working with Prof. Chang in civil engineering department because he is too nice and I was too numb not seeing what I really want to pursue, thanks to the spoon-feeding Taiwanese educational system and my self-deception from the uninformed, vague childhood interest in civil structure. :sweat_smile: Fortunately I had Prof. Chang's unwaivering guidance that enlightens me to use my gift and intest in fundamental science and technology. :stars:
