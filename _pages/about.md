Welcome! You have bumped into Yuan's personal website. I am now a visiting scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working with [Prof. Grace Gu](https://gu.berkeley.edu/) in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.berkeley.edu/).

**My research interests** broadly lie in computational materials physics and mechanics at the atomic and molecular levels, with an emphasis on the theory and application of *ab initio* calculations, molecular dynamics, and machine learning to tackle challenges across energy, materials, pharmaceutics, devices, and computing. The nature of my research is highly multidisciplinary, requiring a knack to analyze and interpret a wealth amount of data in multi-scale systems across different time (from femtoseconds to years) and length (from Angstroms to meters) scales. 

**Previously** I earned my BS in [Civil Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) and MS in [Structural Engineering](http://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), under the supervision by [Prof. Shu-Wei Chang](https://www.swc-lab.tw/). I was a structural engineering intern at [T.Y. LIN](https://www.tylin.com/) in 2018 and was a full-stack intern at [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw/) in 2021. 

<!-- I have worked on various materials systems, *e.g.* ceramics, composites, and proteins, through the lens of computational modeling/simulation, machine learning, and high-performance computing. I am capable of working with a wide spectrum of scientific and technological communities, including condensed matter physics, computational physics/mechanics, materials science, biophysics, and deep learning. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
